Software Requirements Specification
E-Commerce Platform - "ShopEase"
Version 1.0

1. Introduction

1.1 Purpose
This document describes the software requirements for ShopEase, an e-commerce platform that enables customers to browse products, place orders, and manage their accounts.

1.2 Scope
ShopEase is a web-based e-commerce application consisting of multiple bounded contexts including Customer Management, Order Processing, Inventory Management, and Payment Processing.

2. System Overview

2.1 Product Perspective
ShopEase operates as a standalone e-commerce platform with integrations to external payment gateways and shipping providers.

3. Domain Model Requirements

3.1 Customer Management Context

The Customer entity represents an individual or organization that registers on the platform to purchase products. Each Customer has a unique identifier, email address, and profile information.

Important: The term "Customer" must be used consistently. Terms like "Client", "User", "Buyer", or "Shopper" should NOT be used as they create confusion in the ubiquitous language.

A Customer can have multiple Addresses stored in their account. An Address is a value object containing street, city, postal code, and country information.

Customers can create Wishlists to save products they are interested in for future purchase.

3.2 Order Processing Context

An Order represents a Customer's request to purchase one or more products. Each Order has a unique order number, creation date, and status.

Important: The term "Order" must be used consistently. Terms like "Purchase", "Transaction", "Sale", or "Acquisition" should NOT be used.

An Order contains multiple OrderItems. Each OrderItem represents a specific product and quantity within the order.

The OrderStatus value object tracks the lifecycle of an order: Pending, Confirmed, Shipped, Delivered, or Cancelled.

Domain Events in Order Processing:
- OrderPlaced: Triggered when a customer submits a new order
- OrderConfirmed: Triggered when payment is successfully processed
- OrderShipped: Triggered when the order is dispatched
- OrderDelivered: Triggered when delivery is confirmed
- OrderCancelled: Triggered when an order is cancelled

3.3 Inventory Management Context

A Product represents an item available for sale on the platform. Each Product has a SKU, name, description, and price.

Important: The term "Product" must be used consistently. Terms like "Item", "Good", "Merchandise", or "Article" should NOT be used.

The StockLevel value object tracks the available quantity of each product. It includes current quantity, reserved quantity, and reorder threshold.

A Category organizes products into logical groups for easier navigation.

Domain Events in Inventory:
- StockDepleted: Triggered when stock falls below reorder threshold
- StockReplenished: Triggered when new inventory arrives
- ProductCreated: Triggered when a new product is added
- ProductDiscontinued: Triggered when a product is removed from sale

3.4 Payment Processing Context

A Payment represents a financial transaction for an order. Each Payment has a unique transaction ID, amount, currency, and status.

Important: The term "Payment" must be used consistently. Terms like "Transaction", "Charge", "Bill", or "Invoice" should NOT be used for payment operations.

The Money value object represents monetary values with currency and amount attributes.

PaymentMethod stores the customer's payment information (credit card, PayPal, etc.).

Domain Events in Payment:
- PaymentInitiated: Triggered when payment processing begins
- PaymentCompleted: Triggered when payment is successful
- PaymentFailed: Triggered when payment is declined
- RefundProcessed: Triggered when a refund is issued

4. Context Dependencies

The following dependencies exist between bounded contexts:

- Order Processing depends on Customer Management (to retrieve customer information)
- Order Processing depends on Inventory Management (to check product availability)
- Order Processing depends on Payment Processing (to process payments)
- Payment Processing depends on Customer Management (to retrieve payment methods)

Note: Direct dependencies between Inventory Management and Payment Processing are NOT allowed. They must communicate through Order Processing.

5. Global Naming Rules

5.1 Naming Convention
All entity and class names must use PascalCase (e.g., Customer, OrderItem, StockLevel).

5.2 Banned Global Terms
The following generic terms are banned across all contexts as they violate DDD principles:
- Manager (use specific service names instead)
- Helper (use explicit purpose names)
- Util / Utility (use domain-specific names)
- Data (use explicit entity names)
- Info (use specific attribute names)
- Handler (use event-specific names)
- Processor (use domain action names)

6. Non-Functional Requirements

6.1 Performance
- API response time should be under 200ms for 95% of requests
- System should handle 1000 concurrent users

6.2 Security
- All customer data must be encrypted at rest
- Payment information must comply with PCI-DSS standards
