Digital Banking Platform - "SecureBank"
Version 1.0

1. Introduction

1.1 Purpose
This document describes the software requirements for SecureBank, a digital banking platform that enables customers to manage accounts, perform transactions, and access financial services.

1.2 Scope
SecureBank is a comprehensive banking application consisting of multiple bounded contexts including Account Management, Transaction Processing, Loan Management, and Card Services.

2. System Overview

2.1 Product Perspective
SecureBank operates as a digital banking platform with integrations to external payment networks, credit bureaus, and regulatory compliance systems.

3. Domain Model Requirements

3.1 Account Management Context

The Account entity represents a financial account held by a customer. Each Account has a unique account number, account type, and balance.

Important: The term "Account" must be used consistently. Terms like "Profile", "Wallet", "Portfolio", or "Record" should NOT be used as they create confusion in the ubiquitous language.

An Account can be one of several types: CheckingAccount, SavingsAccount, or MoneyMarketAccount.

The AccountHolder entity represents the owner of the account with personal and contact information.

Accounts have an AccountStatus value object tracking states: Active, Frozen, Closed, Dormant.

3.2 Transaction Processing Context

A Transaction represents a financial operation on an account. Each Transaction has a unique transaction ID, timestamp, amount, and type.

Important: The term "Transaction" must be used consistently. Terms like "Operation", "Transfer", "Movement", or "Activity" should NOT be used.

A Transaction contains a TransactionType value object (Deposit, Withdrawal, Transfer, Payment).

The Money value object represents monetary amounts with currency and precise decimal values.

Domain Events in Transaction Processing:
- TransactionInitiated: Triggered when a transaction is requested
- TransactionAuthorized: Triggered when transaction passes validation
- TransactionCompleted: Triggered when transaction is finalized
- TransactionFailed: Triggered when transaction cannot complete
- TransactionReversed: Triggered when transaction is rolled back

3.3 Loan Management Context

A Loan represents borrowed funds with repayment terms. Each Loan has a unique loan number, principal amount, interest rate, and repayment schedule.

Important: The term "Loan" must be used consistently. Terms like "Credit", "Debt", "Financing", or "Advance" should NOT be used interchangeably.

The LoanApplication aggregate manages the loan approval process with credit checks and underwriting.

A RepaymentSchedule value object defines payment amounts, frequencies, and due dates.

Domain Events in Loan Management:
- LoanApplicationSubmitted: Triggered when customer applies for loan
- LoanApproved: Triggered when underwriting approves loan
- LoanDisbursed: Triggered when loan funds are released
- PaymentReceived: Triggered when loan payment is made
- LoanDefaulted: Triggered when payment becomes overdue

3.4 Card Services Context

A Card represents a payment card issued to a customer. Each Card has a unique card number, expiration date, and card type.

Important: The term "Card" must be used consistently. Terms like "PaymentMethod", "Instrument", "Token", or "Device" should NOT be used for card operations.

The CardType value object specifies Debit, Credit, or Prepaid card categories.

A CardTransaction links card usage to the transaction processing context.

Domain Events in Card Services:
- CardIssued: Triggered when new card is created
- CardActivated: Triggered when customer activates card
- CardBlocked: Triggered when card is frozen for security
- CardExpired: Triggered when card reaches expiration
- CardReplaced: Triggered when card is reissued

4. Context Dependencies

The following dependencies exist between bounded contexts:

- Transaction Processing depends on Account Management (to verify account status and balance)
- Loan Management depends on Account Management (to link loans to customer accounts)
- Card Services depends on Account Management (to associate cards with accounts)
- Card Services depends on Transaction Processing (to process card payments)

Note: Direct dependencies between Loan Management and Card Services are NOT allowed. They must communicate through Account Management.

5. Global Naming Rules

5.1 Naming Convention
All entity and class names must use PascalCase (e.g., Account, Transaction, LoanApplication).

5.2 Banned Global Terms
The following generic terms are banned across all contexts as they violate DDD principles:
- Manager (use specific service names instead)
- Helper (use explicit purpose names)
- Util / Utility (use domain-specific names)
- Data (use explicit entity names)
- Handler (use domain-specific orchestrators)
- Service (use specific domain service names)

6. Compliance and Security

6.1 Regulatory Compliance
All operations must comply with banking regulations including KYC, AML, and SOX requirements.

6.2 Security Requirements
Multi-factor authentication and encryption required for all sensitive operations.
