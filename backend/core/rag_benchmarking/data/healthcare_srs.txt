Software Requirements Specification
Healthcare Management System - "MediCare Pro"
Version 1.0

1. Introduction

1.1 Purpose
This document describes the software requirements for MediCare Pro, a healthcare management system that enables medical professionals to manage patient records, appointments, treatments, and prescriptions.

1.2 Scope
MediCare Pro is a comprehensive healthcare application consisting of multiple bounded contexts including Patient Management, Appointment Scheduling, Treatment Planning, and Prescription Management.

2. System Overview

2.1 Product Perspective
MediCare Pro operates as a standalone healthcare platform with integrations to external pharmacy systems and insurance providers.

3. Domain Model Requirements

3.1 Patient Management Context

The Patient entity represents an individual receiving medical care at the facility. Each Patient has a unique medical record number (MRN), personal information, and medical history.

Important: The term "Patient" must be used consistently. Terms like "Client", "Customer", "Case", or "Person" should NOT be used as they create confusion in the ubiquitous language.

A Patient has a MedicalHistory value object that tracks previous diagnoses, treatments, and allergies.

Patients can have multiple EmergencyContacts stored in their records. An EmergencyContact contains name, relationship, and contact information.

Patients are assigned to a PrimaryCarePhysician who coordinates their overall care.

3.2 Appointment Scheduling Context

An Appointment represents a scheduled visit between a Patient and a healthcare provider. Each Appointment has a unique appointment ID, scheduled time, and status.

Important: The term "Appointment" must be used consistently. Terms like "Visit", "Meeting", "Consultation", or "Session" should NOT be used.

An Appointment contains an AppointmentType value object (CheckUp, FollowUp, Emergency, Procedure).

The AppointmentStatus value object tracks the lifecycle: Scheduled, Confirmed, InProgress, Completed, Cancelled, NoShow.

Domain Events in Appointment Scheduling:
- AppointmentScheduled: Triggered when a new appointment is booked
- AppointmentConfirmed: Triggered when patient confirms attendance
- AppointmentStarted: Triggered when patient checks in
- AppointmentCompleted: Triggered when visit concludes
- AppointmentCancelled: Triggered when appointment is cancelled

3.3 Treatment Planning Context

A Treatment represents a medical intervention or therapy prescribed to a patient. Each Treatment has a unique treatment ID, description, and duration.

Important: The term "Treatment" must be used consistently. Terms like "Procedure", "Service", "Therapy", or "Intervention" should NOT be used interchangeably.

The TreatmentPlan aggregate organizes multiple treatments into a coordinated care strategy.

A Diagnosis value object captures the medical condition being addressed, including ICD codes.

Domain Events in Treatment:
- TreatmentPrescribed: Triggered when a new treatment is ordered
- TreatmentStarted: Triggered when treatment begins
- TreatmentCompleted: Triggered when treatment concludes
- TreatmentModified: Triggered when treatment plan changes

3.4 Prescription Management Context

A Prescription represents a medication order for a patient. Each Prescription has a unique prescription number, medication details, dosage, and duration.

Important: The term "Prescription" must be used consistently. Terms like "Order", "Script", "Medication", or "Drug" should NOT be used for prescription operations.

The Medication value object represents drug information with name, strength, and form.

The Dosage value object specifies quantity, frequency, and administration route.

Domain Events in Prescription:
- PrescriptionIssued: Triggered when prescription is written
- PrescriptionFilled: Triggered when pharmacy dispenses medication
- PrescriptionRenewed: Triggered when prescription is renewed
- PrescriptionCancelled: Triggered when prescription is voided

4. Context Dependencies

The following dependencies exist between bounded contexts:

- Appointment Scheduling depends on Patient Management (to retrieve patient information)
- Treatment Planning depends on Patient Management (to access medical history)
- Treatment Planning depends on Appointment Scheduling (to link treatments to visits)
- Prescription Management depends on Patient Management (to verify patient identity)
- Prescription Management depends on Treatment Planning (to ensure prescribed medications align with treatment)

Note: Direct dependencies between Appointment Scheduling and Prescription Management are NOT allowed. They must communicate through Treatment Planning.

5. Global Naming Rules

5.1 Naming Convention
All entity and class names must use PascalCase (e.g., Patient, MedicalHistory, AppointmentStatus).

5.2 Banned Global Terms
The following generic terms are banned across all contexts as they violate DDD principles:
- Manager (use specific service names instead)
- Helper (use explicit purpose names)
- Util / Utility (use domain-specific names)
- Data (use explicit entity names)
- Handler (use domain-specific orchestrators)

6. Compliance and Security

6.1 HIPAA Compliance
All patient data must comply with HIPAA regulations regarding privacy and security.

6.2 Access Control
Role-based access control must be implemented for Physicians, Nurses, and Administrative staff.
